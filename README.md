# RstudioProject
Overview

This repository contains R code and related resources for data analysis and visualization. It is intended as a starting point or template for RStudio-based projects.
Code Structure

    The code in this repository is written in R, a popular language for statistical computing and data analysis.
    Typical R projects include scripts for data cleaning, analysis, and visualization. These scripts are usually organized by task or by data source.
    If there are R scripts (e.g., .R files), each script may focus on different stages of a data science workflow, such as:
        Data Import: Loading raw data from CSV, Excel, or other formats.
        Data Cleaning: Handling missing values, filtering, and transforming variables.
        Analysis: Statistical analysis, hypothesis testing, or machine learning.
        Visualization: Creating plots using packages like ggplot2.

Dataset

    If the repository contains datasets (e.g., .csv, .xlsx files), these are typically placed in a data/ directory or referenced directly in the scripts.
    The datasets are used to demonstrate data analysis workflows in R.
    Common dataset tasks include loading, exploring, and visualizing data.

How to Use

    Clone the repository to your local machine:
    Code

    git clone https://github.com/duketopceo/RstudioProject.git

    Open the project in RStudio.
    Install required R packages as needed (e.g., tidyverse, ggplot2).
    Run the scripts in sequence or as described in script comments.

Requirements

    R and RStudio installed on your system.
    Additional R packages may be required depending on the analysis.
